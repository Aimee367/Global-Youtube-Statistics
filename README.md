# Global-Youtube-Statistics

***Overview***
This project analyzes YouTube engagement data to identify global trends, predict performance metrics, and segment creators based on content popularity. The analysis helps provide actionable insights for creators, marketers, and platform strategists.

***Objectives***
- Understand global engagement trends, including views, likes, and subscriber growth.
- Cluster creators into groups based on performance metrics.
- Predict top-performing creators using machine learning algorithms.

***Methodology***

1) Data Preprocessing:
- Removed outliers and imputed missing values.
- Normalized features for clustering analysis.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Identified key performance metrics such as average engagement rate and view-to-subscriber ratio.
- Visualized relationships between metrics using scatter plots and box plots.
3) Clustering Analysis:
- Utilized K-Means clustering to segment creators into performance tiers.
- Generated dendrograms for hierarchical clustering.
4) Predictive Modeling:
- Trained regression models to predict future performance.

***Tools & Technologies***
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

***Results & Insights***
- Discovered that creators with high engagement rates tend to diversify their content categories.
- Identified performance disparities based on geography and video genres.
- Predicted top-performing creators with a high degree of accuracy.
